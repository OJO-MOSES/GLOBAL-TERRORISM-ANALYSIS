### Project Overview

Welcome to my portfolio project centered on data analysis and visualization through Power BI. For this project, I extensively investigated global terrorism trends. Utilizing Power BI for analysis and visualization, my goal was to reveal significant patterns and derive actionable insights from data ranging from 1970 to 2017.
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing global terrorism, offering a thorough overview of key trends and patterns spanning the past five decades. The report aims to assist researchers, policymakers, and stakeholders in comprehending terrorist activity trends, pinpointing hotspots, enhancing security measures, and promoting international collaboration to counter global threats.

### Data Source

Global Terrorism Dataset: The primary dataset used for this analysis can be [Downloaded Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ksh1AHfDVLInBmqNyOcHAxErdngnGRYc)

### Tools

- Excel
- Power BI

### Data Cleaning/Preparation.

The data was containing errors, duplicates, and blank or missing values. Each document was reviewed to confirm data types, errors, duplicates, and replacements were made as needed.
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the global terrorism data to answer key questions, such as;

- What is the success rate by the types of weapons?
- What is the success rate by the target types?
- What is the success rate by the types of attack?
- What is the success rate by the name of the trrrorist's groups?
- What is the success rate by the regions?
- What's the total attack per year?
- What is the total target?
- Which weapon is the most used weapon?
- Which group is the deadliest group?
- Which year has the maximum attacks?

### Results and Findings

1. Explosives has the highest success rate.
2. The categories of people that fell victim of terrorism most are the private citizens.
3. The Middle East has the highest success rate.
4. The total attacks over the years is 175.79k
5. The most used weapon is explosives.
6. Taliban is the deadliest group.
7. 2017 is the year with the maximum attacks.

### Recommendations
After analyzing the data, it is imperative for all concerned stakeholders to;
- convene and develop strategies and policies aimed at curbing or eradicating terrorism.
- formulate policies that guides the production and possession of ammunitions.
- enlighten the people on the importance of world peace.


### Limitation
It's important to note that the dataset only includes data from 1970 to 2017, which could restrict the analysis of recent global terrorism trends.
